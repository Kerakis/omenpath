Simple Name (the "Name" field has excess stuff like "(Halo Foil)" added), Set Code (most match Scryfall but not all), and Card Number.

Condition is the same as what Moxfield expects.

Language is the same except except for Chinese (Traditional and Simplified). I've included the examples of both.

Foil is "Normal" vs "Foil". Etched and other speciality foil status is derived from the CN.

You're already using the Product ID when you export cards from the Wishlist/Buy a Deck feature to TCGPlayer. Maybe you can utilize TCGPlayer's API when importing one of their CSVs to get the correct version or just match "tcgplayer_id" from the Scryfall JSON? Most cards will likely import fine, but I foresee issues with promo cards and art cards (I know they aren't supported...yet :P).

The TCGPlayer APP has an advanced option to "include Gatherer ID" that isn't on by default, but it doesn't seem to work as every card that I tried simply has "0" as the Gatherer ID, which shows up as "External ID" in the CSV. I didn't include that in the CSV example as it the option isn't enabled by default and doesn't seem to be useful.
