CardCastle offers both a CardCastle CSV and a Simple CSV. Both are problematic.

The "CardCastle" CSV is nice that it provides the Scryfall ID under the column header "JSON ID" making it much easier to import. The downside is that it doesn't include the fucking card count. 

"Price USD" can be mapped to "Purchase Price".

"Foil" is a boolean field.

"Language" is all shorthand, but they seem to match Scryfall's syntax, even if Scryfall doesn't list them in their docs. For example, CardCastle uses `tw` for Traditional Chinese, but Scryfall only lists `zht` and `ct` as Traditional Chinese, but `lang:tw` still works.

"Condition" options are "Near Mint", "Lightly Played", "Moderately Played", "Heavily Played", and "Damaged".

As for the Simple CSV, it has the count, but only uses the Set Name and not the Set Code. The set names match up with the set names for Scryfall, so I guess it is possible to use "Card Name", "Set Name", and "Collector Number" to find the cards. At least this one includes a "Count" field.

"Foil" is still a boolean field.
